    <h1 class="header1">Rubiks Cube Sides</h1>

    <p class="paragraph1">
        The rubiks cube has a total of 6 sides, each having a different color. Because of this the pieces on each side
        must be identified in order to get them back in their proper positions. A singular edge piece has 2 colors and there is 4 
        of them on each side. Corner Pieces have 3 colors on them and there are 4 each per color. Each color also has a center piece and is only 1 color 
        Colors positions do matter as colors that are opposite of each other will not have a edge piece or corner piece with both colors on it. Red is opposite of orange,
        blue is opposite of green, and white is opposite of yellow

    <h2 class="header2">Turning the Cube</h2>

    <p class="paragraph2">
        Just like the pieces in a rubiks cube there is also identification for turning the cube.  R is for right wedge(clockwise is up), L is for left side (clockwise is down), 
        U is the top wedge(clockwise is left), D is for the bottom wedge (clockwise is right), F is for rotating the side in front of you (clockwise is left), back is the wedge opposite of (clockwise it right) 
        Also 2 means that the side needs to be turned twice as it doesnt matter if you turn it clockwise or counter clockwise. For counter clickwise turns there is an apostrophy next to the letter to show it 
        turns in the opposite direction. <a href="https://blocem.blogspot.com/2012/03/notasi-dan-bagian-bagian-rubik.html">This link</a> can show more about all these details(this site is where I got the first image from).

        Below are some patterns you can create with the rubiks cube using 
        the algorithms listed below which can help get you familiar with using algorithms. To perform the correctly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtY7hOIAj6E"> Use this video</a> 
        and follow along with the youtuber doing the alorithms to perform them with 100% success(Also I did test these algorithms before putting them in the list)
